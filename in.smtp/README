in.smtp is tiny, inetd-based mail relay for systems with
limited resources. It will receive email via SMTP, then retransmit
it using the system sendmail. 

It is useful for having a single relay host on your network for
transmitting mail. I use it on my NSLU2 (slug) to allow all the hosts
on my network to relay outbound mail (via ssmtp).

SECURITY:
=================

Host filtering should be done via the tcpd wrapper (or xinetd if that's
what you're using).

INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.smtp:

   make

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.smtp /usr/local/bin

3. Add an inetd entry (this assumes Debian, and 
   that the /usr/sbin/tcpd wrapper is available) to inetd.conf:

   smtp stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/in.smtp

4. Restart inetd
