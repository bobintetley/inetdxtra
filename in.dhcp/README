in.dhcp tiny DHCP server

in.dhcp is a tiny, inetd-based DHCP server designed for devices with
limited resources. I used it to replace ISC-DHCP on my slug as it
does not run when requests aren't being made and my home network
is pretty low traffic with only 10 or so connected devices (in.dhcp
is so light that it will scale MUCH higher).

It supports ipv4, pools, static leases and all the DHCP options. I've
tested with the ISC DHCP client, my Wii, udhcp and the Hauppage
MVP H series devices (all work, obviously).

In addition, if -DUSE_NSS is set, it will use the system NSS to discover
hostname and IP addresses for a given MAC address (see ether_ntohost)

INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.dhcp:

    make

    (you can also edit this file and use the line below "exit 0" to compile
    in.dhcp with debug information sent to syslog and response packets dumped
    to a file in /tmp).

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.dhcp /usr/local/bin

3. Create /etc/in.dhcp.conf.eth0 (or whatever interface you are supplying
   addresses for) and add your hosts (see in.dhcp.conf.sample for the
   full range of options - ALL standard DHCP options are supported)

4. Add an inetd entry to inetd.conf (note the second variant, you can include
   a bind address to determine which interface reply packets will be sent to).

   bootps dgram udp wait nobody /usr/local/bin/in.dhcp in.dhcp eth0
   bootps dgram udp wait nobody /usr/local/bin/in.dhcp in.dhcp eth0 192.168.0.1

5. Restart inetd
