This application is covered by the terms of the GPLv2.

in.proxy is a tiny, inetd-based http proxy designed for devices with 
limited resources. It does not do caching and is intended as a relay. 
It can handle CONNECT and can be used as an SSL proxy too.

It is intended as a lightweight HTTP relay and can be combined with
VPN software to offer a secure, anonymous browsing service.

LOGGING:
=================

Makefile has a switch for logging. This is on by default.

-DONELOG - Output a log file in /var/log/in.proxy.log in NCSA
           combined format for each request. NOTE: You must run
           in.proxy as a user with write permissions to 
           /var/log if you use this option.


You can use x/inetd and tcpd as with any other inetd service to 
restrict access from hosts and to limit the number of in.proxy 
processes.


INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.proxy:

   make

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.proxy /usr/local/bin

3. Add an inetd entry (this assumes Debian, with user www-data and 
   that the /usr/sbin/tcpd wrapper is available) to inetd.conf:

   webcache stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/in.proxy

4. Restart inetd

Define the HTTP proxy in your browser as <slug host> port 8080
