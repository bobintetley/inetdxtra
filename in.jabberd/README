in.jabberd Jabber Server
Copyright(c)2008, Robin Rawson-Tetley

in.jabberd is a tiny, inetd-based jabber server designed for devices with 
limited resources. I used it to replace jabberd (which I couldn't get to 
build for the ARM chip in my NSLU2 anyway). It uses just 84K per process
when it is running.

WARNING: in.jabberd is a long way from a complete Jabberd implementation.
It has just enough to allow logging in, chatting and basic presence
information with the following caveats:

1. Only plaintext passwords and SHA-1 digest authentication are supported.

2. All users on the server are instantly each other's buddy - subscriptions
   are not supported.

3. It *may* not be portable outside of Linux. It relies on 
   O_NONBLOCK fd to allow non-blocking IO on stdin and flock(LOCK_EX)
   to synchronise access to message files.

4. I've tested with 2 different versions of pidgin and the gossip jabber
   client so far.

5. It uses the Linux-specific trick of overwriting argv[0] to update the
   information for ps. If you don't want this (or your OS doesn't support
   it), remove the -DUPDATEPS flag from the compile script.


INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.jabberd:

    make

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.jabberd /usr/local/bin
   cp man/in.jabberd.1.gz /usr/local/man

3. Create /etc/in.jabberd.conf and add a linebreak separated list of people
   who will use the server, along with their passwords.

   This file is used to determine the friend roster as well as
   who can log in. The space around the colon is important.

   user1 : password1
   user2 : password2
   ...

4. Add an inetd entry (this assumes Debian, and 
   that the /usr/sbin/tcpd wrapper is available) to inetd.conf:

   www stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/in.jabberd

5. Restart inetd

For more info, run "man in.jabberd"
