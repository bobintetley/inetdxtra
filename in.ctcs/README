Copyright(c)2008, Robin Rawson-Tetley
This application is covered by the terms of the GPLv2.

in.ctcs is a tiny, inetd-based CTCS server for the enhanced
CTorrent application.

It can co-ordinate bandwidth between multiple ctorrent processes
(it monitors the downloads and gives extra bandwidth to faster downloads
from slower ones, if the slower ones pick up, it shares the bandwidth
evenly) and it writes a simple 
information file at an interval that can be used by other applications 
to discover torrent progress. It also polls for an input file so other
applications can send messages to a torrent process (in.ctcs.PID and
in.ctcs.PID.in in your /tmp directory).

A simple CGI UI is included in the www folder, copy it to the
document root for your in.www webserver and update the "download_location"
file with the path to where torrent files should be downloaded to.
In addition to the ctorrent binary on your path, you will also need
wget. The pages included allow you to monitor and stop downloads, as
well as paste torrent links to start downloads off.

in.ctcs will watch the download rate and if it falls below 5Kb/s, it
will automatically try to get more peers from the tracker. If that
fails and download speed falls below 2Kb/s, it will try to reconnect 
to the tracker as a fresh client to obtain new peers. It will only try
these steps once every 5 minutes where necessary.

INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.ctcs:

   make

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.ctcs /usr/local/bin

3. Add a services entry to /etc/services:
   ctcs         2780/tcp

4. Add an inetd entry (this assumes Debian, and 
   that the /usr/sbin/tcpd wrapper is available) to inetd.conf:

   ctcs stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/in.ctcs 64 32

   The three arguments are download limit in Kb and upload limit in Kb
   If the connection is terminated, the in.ctcs.PID file will be removed.

5. Restart inetd

6. Edit /var/www/download_location and enter your desired download directory

7. If you are using in.www, make a symlink from /your/download/directory
   to download_dir in /var/www - this allows the "View Download Directory"
   link to work in the web interface. For apache, you'll have to use an
   Alias to map your download directory to http://yourhost/download_dir
   instead (and make sure Indexes are on for that directory).

   ln -sf /your/download/dir /var/www/download_dir
