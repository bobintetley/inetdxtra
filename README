Additional protocol servers for inetd

inetdxtra is a group of additional servers to add new protocols to 
inetd/xinetd. These programs are all tiny, written in C with no
dependences and use well under 100Kb of RAM each. With them being
inetd servers, they only run when a request is made or a session
in progress.

They were written for my NSLU2/slug, which runs Debian ARMel,however 
they should be good for any embedded device where resources are tight. 

Servers include:

in.www  -       An inetd based webserver with CGI support
in.proxy -      An inetd based HTTP proxy server
in.jabberd -    An inetd based jabber server
in.mvp -        An inetd based version of the mvprelay.c file
in.dns -        An inetd based authoritative DNS server
in.dhcp -       An inetd based DHCP server
in.smtp -       An inetd based SMTP relay
in.ctcs -       An inetd based CTCS server for enhanced CTorrent clients

The individual programs have their own readme files in the subdirectories
below this one.

Installation
==================

You will need gcc and make.


make
make install


You will need to update your inetd.conf file (a sample is included) or
add xinetd.d files for each of these services. In addition, most of
these servers require a single config file of their own in /etc.
Samples are included.

It's possible to enable additional logging and output for debugging
purposes by editing the CFLAGS value in the Makefile (comments are
included).

You can also change the installation prefix in the Makefile.
